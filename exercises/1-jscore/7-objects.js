/*
    Step1: 
    - Build a function that given the needed information calculates the monthly net Salary by:
        - Employees with age below or equal 30 pay the percentage of BELOW30_TAXES to the government
        - Employees with age above 30 pay the percentage of ABOVE30_TAXES to the government
    Step2:
        - Employees can choose to get 2 extra payments or not, if they choose 14 payments the gross salary will be divided by 14, otherwise by 12
        - Employees with a degree of disability, have a reduction of 3% in their goverment taxes
        - Tip: create a variable with the % of taxes
    Step3:
        - Build an array with all the employees
        - Use forEach to console.log the name and the netSalary of all employees
